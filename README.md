# commercetools Connect Marketplacer Accelerator

## About the accelerator

The commercetools Marketplacer Accelerator for Connect provides the following functionality:

- Sync newly created Products in Marketplacer to commercetools
- Sync newly created Sellers in Marketplacer to commercetools

In both cases we employ Marketplacer webhooks to allow for a near real-time sync cadence.

> The accelerator is certified for [commercetools Connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect), which essentially allows you to run it within your existing commercetools instance. You can read more about [commercetools Connect here](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect).

## Solution Overview

![solution](https://github.com/marketplacer/commercetools-connect-Marketplacer-Accelerator/assets/815719/2ed299f7-cfd1-49fc-8d13-6f90d5490584)

The accelerator is implemented as a Google Cloud Function providing the following 2 HTTPS POST endpoints:

- `create-variants-function`: This endpoint receives an Advert webhook event from Marketplacer and uses it to create a product in commercetools
- `create-custom-objects-function`: This endpoint receives a Seller webhook event from Marketplacer and uses it to create a custom object in commercetools

<br/>

> Adverts in Marketplacer are analogous to products, hence why we make use of an Advert webhook.

## Setting Up the Accelerator

### commercetools set up

#### Pre-requisites

Before configuring the commercetools Connect Marketplacer Accelerator in **commercetools** you will require:

- An instance of commercetools and access to Merchant Center
- An [API client created via Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started/create-api-client)
- API Client credentials set aside (you wil need access to these later)
- An [access token generated by making a call to the the Authorization API endpoint](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started/make-first-api-call#get-your-access-token)

Once you have these, you can move on to setting up the accelerator

#### Step 1: Search for the Accelerator

Make an API call to the following commercetools endpoint to return all certified Connect apps

`GET: https://connect.{your-commercetools-region}.commercetools.com/connectors/search`

The name of the app that you are looking for is: `Marketplacer commercetools connector`

> You can further refine your search by providing various search criteria as [outlined here](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/connectors#search-connectors).

When you locate the app that you want, be sure to copy the following values as you'll need these when creating a deployment:

- `connector.id`
- `connector.version`

#### Step 2: Obtain commercetools product identifiers

In order for the connector to successfully create products in commercetools it needs the following information:

- The Main Product Type
- The Root Category
- A Child Category (of the root)

We can obtain these values from the commercetools [Impex tool](https://impex.australia-southeast1.gcp.commercetools.com/) - note the login credentials for Impex are the same as those for Merchant Center.

- Login to [Impex](https://impex.australia-southeast1.gcp.commercetools.com/)
- Select API Playground

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

- Select `Product Types` for the endpoint:

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

- Running your query should return a series of JSON objects, select a `key` value for th Product Type that you want to work with. In the example below I've selected `shirts`:

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

Set this value aside as we'll be using that as our Main Product Type.

---

Back at the main Impext API Playground search page, select `Categories` for the endpoint:

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

- Running your query should return a series of JSON objects, select an `id` value for an appropriate Root Category, in the example below I have selected the `id` for the `Men` category:

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

> Root categories should not have any "Ancestors".

Set this value aside as we'll be using that as our Root Category.

---

- Within the same result payload,(Categories search), find a suitable Child category. A suitable Child category would be one that has the Root category as an "ancestor", in the example below I've selected `Tops`:

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

Set this value aside as we'll be using that as our Main Child Category.

#### Step 3: Deploy the app

The next API call creates a deployment for your selected app, (in this case the Marketplacer connector). To ensure a valid call you need to provide a valid `body` payload as outlined below, (you will need to insert your own values where directed):

```json
{
  "key": "{insert your own unique key value for this deloyment}",
  "connector": {
    "id": "{the id as retrived form the previous API call}",
    "version": {the version of the connector you want to deploy}
  },
  "region": "{your commercetools region}",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "applicationName": "create-custom-objects-function",
      "standardConfiguration": [
        {
          "key": "CTP_REGION",
          "value": "{your commercetools region}"
        }
      ],
      "securedConfiguration": [
        {
          "key": "CTP_PROJECT_KEY",
          "value": "{your API client project key}"
        },
        {
          "key": "CTP_CLIENT_ID",
          "value": "{your API client id}"
        },
        {
          "key": "CTP_CLIENT_SECRET",
          "value": "{your API Client Secret}"
        },
        {
          "key": "CTP_SCOPE",
          "value": "{your api client scope}"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "applicationName": "create-variants-function",
      "standardConfiguration": [
        {
          "key": "CTP_REGION",
          "value": "{your commercetools region}"
        }
      ],
      "securedConfiguration": [
        {
          "key": "CTP_PROJECT_KEY",
          "value": "{your API client project key}"
        },
        {
          "key": "CTP_CLIENT_ID",
          "value": "{your API client id}"
        },
        {
          "key": "CTP_CLIENT_SECRET",
          "value": "{your API Client Secret}"
        },
        {
          "key": "CTP_SCOPE",
          "value": "{your api client scope}"
        },
        {
          "key": "mainProductType",
          "value": "{your Product Type}"
        },
        {
          "key": "rootCategory",
          "value": "{your Root Category}"
        },
        {
          "key": "childCategory",
          "value": "{your Child Category}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> Note: all the configured values are strings, with the exception of `version` which is a number, so be sure to omit quotes with this value.

Once you have constructed your payload make a POST request as follows:

`POST: https://connect.{your-commercetools-region}.commercetools.com/{your-project-key}/deployments`

This will create a deployment in the `deploying` state - you can read more about the [deployments endpoint here](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/deployments).

#### Step 4: Check on your deployment

In order to use the connector you will need to ensure that the state transitions from: `deploying` to `deployed`, you can do this by querying your deployments as follows:

`GET: https://connect.{your-commercetools-region}.commercetools.com/{your-project-key}/deployments`

As part of the return payload for your deployment you should obtain:

- `status`: this should have a value of `deployed`
- `results.applications[0].url` 
- `results.applications[1].url`

In the case of the 2x `url` values, you should have value for both:

- The Variants function
- The Custom Objects function

Put the 2 values for each url aside (and ensure that you tag them correctly against each function).


### Marketplacer set up

#### Pre-requisites

Before configuring the commercetools Connect Marketplacer Accelerator in **Marketplacer** you will require:

- An instance of Marketplacer and access to the Operator Portal as an Admin

Once you have this, you can move on to setting up the accelerator in Marketplacer

#### Step 1: Create an Advert Webhook

Create an Advert Webhook in the Operator by following the [instructions here](https://dev.marketplacer.com/docs/webhooks/webhooksgettingstarted/), use the following values:

- `Type`: Advert
- `Event Name (filter)`: Create
- `URL`: Use the `url` value for the `create-variants-function` that you obtained from the commercetools app deployment
- `Headers`: You can leave this blank, it is not required for the accelerator tyo work
- `HMAC Key`: You can leave this blank, it is not required for the accelerator tyo work
- `GraphQL`: Use the query listed below:


```graphql
query ($id: ID!) {
  node(id: $id) {
    ... on Advert {
      __typename
      id
      legacyId
      title
      fullTitle
      description

            barcode
            sku
            countOnHand
            lowestPrice
            advert
            optionValues {
              nodes {
                name
                optionType {
                  name
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When done click Save.

#### Step 2: Create a Seller Webhook

Create a Seller Webhook in the Operator by following the [instructions here](https://dev.marketplacer.com/docs/webhooks/webhooksgettingstarted/), use the following values:

- `Type`: Seller
- `Event Name (filter)`: Create
- `URL`: Use the `url` value for the `create-custom-objects-function` that you obtained from the commercetools app deployment
- `Headers`: You can leave this blank, it is not required for the accelerator tyo work
- `HMAC Key`: You can leave this blank, it is not required for the accelerator tyo work
- `GraphQL`: Use the query listed below:

```graphql
query ($id: ID!) {
  node(id: $id) {
    ... on Seller {
      __typename
      id
      businessName
      businessNumber
      emailAddress
      logoUrl
      marketplaceShippingRulesEnabled
      openingHours

      sellerRating
      storeDescription
      youtubeVideoUrl
      address {
        fullAddress
        mapUrl
      }
    }
  }
}
```


When done click Save.

### Running the accelerator

#### Product Creation

To execute the Product create flow you will need to:

1. Create an Advert in Marketplacer
  - This can be done via API
  - Spreadsheet upload
  - Via the Seller Portal
2. Once an Advert is created, this will trigger the Advert Create Webhook which will be received by the accelerator and create a product in commercetools
3. You can check that a product was created in commercetools either by:
  - Using Merchant Center
  - Using Impex
  - Using the API

#### Seller (Custom Object) Creation

To execute the Custom Object create flow you will need to:

1. Create a Seller in Marketplacer
  - This can be done via API
  - Via the Seller Portal
2. Once a Seller is created, this will trigger the Seller Create Webhook which will be received by the accelerator and create a custom object in commercetools
3. You can check that a custom object was created in commercetools either by:
  - Using Impex
  - Using the API
